# Radial-Menu-CSS
Project Description: This repository contains my solution for an assignment where I recreated a radial menu using vanilla CSS. The assignment was based on a Figma design and required the implementation of proper hover effects. The goal was to demonstrate strong CSS skills and the ability to replicate a specific design.
